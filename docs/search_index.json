The package is available on github and is most easily installed via devtools::install_github(\"https://github.com/torekleppe/pdmphmc\") (requires the devtools package) The package implements, with some modifications and substantial additions, the methodology of Kleppe (2022a), Kleppe (2022b). 1.1 What is pdmphmc? pdmphmc is a system for carrying out probability computations, typically associated with Bayesian statistical modelling. pdmphmc consist of A very flexible system for specifying Bayesian statistical models using C++ classes. An implementation of numerical generalized randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers for MCMC-like computations for models specified in the above mentioned system. 1.2 Why pdmphmc? Many packages provides computational methods for Bayesian statistical models. pdmphmc is designed to be computationally fast and stable, even for high-dimensional models and/or models where the posterior distribution exhibits complicated non-linear dependence structures. Particular emphasis has been on developing and implementing methodology suitable for fitting non-linear hierarchical models. 1.3 Prerequisites This documentation assumes basic familiarity with the C++ programming language. This documentation assumes modest familiarity with the Eigen C++ library, see e.g. https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__QuickRefPage.html The package relies on the Stan Math Library (https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/math) for automatic differentiation. In addition, the complete Stan Math Library (including all probability density functions etc) are also available within the modeling facilities of this package. Hence, some familiarity with the probability densities etc documented in https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html may be useful.

On mac, linux, this is typically available as g++ on the command line. If you get an error message when running e.g. g++ -v in the command line, you need to get the g++ for your system. On Windows, testing of pdmphmc is done using the GCC 10/MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain that comes with the Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), but it should also be noted that it should be possible to use different compilers. 2.2 Check your installation The simplest way to check your installation is to try to run the testSystem() success &lt;- pdmphmc::testSystem() ## model name : model ## process type : HMCProcess ## metric tensor type : metricTensorDummy ## compilation exited successfully ## model ran successfully If the last line printed reads “model ran successfully”, you are good to go. If not, there is something wrong with the setup for your system. A good starting point for resolving compilation issues is first check that your installation of package rstan is really working, see https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started for details.

"],["model-specification-details.html", "Chapter 4 Model specification details 4.1 DATA_* statements 4.2 The preProcess() function 4.3 The operator()() function", " Chapter 4 Model specification details 4.1 DATA_* statements The facility for passing data from R to the model is based on the DATA_* preprocessor macros. Currently there are 6 types of these, corresponding to different types of C++ storage in the model: DATA_DOUBLE(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: double DATA_INT(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: int DATA_VECTOR(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: Eigen::VectorXd DATA_IVECTOR(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: Eigen::VectorXi DATA_MATRIX(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: Eigen::MatrixXd DATA_IMATRIX(&lt;dataname&gt;); // C++ storage: Eigen::MatrixXi After putting one or multiple DATA_* statements at the start of the model class, a object with name &lt;dataname&gt; and the indicated type will be available throughout the class. The objects initiated with DATA_* statements are filled using the data argument of the pdmphmc::run function. E.g. if the model class contains struct model{ DATA_DOUBLE(dd); DATA_MATRIX(mat); // rest of model spec here }; then calls to pdmphmc::run must be done with something like # assuming the model has been built into R-variable &quot;model&quot; fit &lt;- run(model,data=list(dd=1.23,mat=matrix(rnorm(4),2,2))) The data are read into the C++ program before any sampling etc is done. 4.2 The preProcess() function The preProcess() is intended for restructuring data, reading data directly from a file etc. The pre-process function gets called after data are read into C++/is available as objects &lt;dataname&gt;. E.g. continuing the example above, e.g. struct model{ DATA_DOUBLE(dd); DATA_MATRIX(mat); double ddHalf_; void preProcess(){ ddHalf_ = 0.5*dd; } // rest of model spec here }; the variable ddHalf_ would contain 0.5*1.23 at the time of sampling if the same data as above are provided. 4.3 The operator()() function The operator()() function is used for specifying (in a broad sense) the target distribution, say \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). It should have the signature: template &lt; class varType, class tensorType, bool storeNames&gt; void operator()(amt::amtModel&lt;varType,tensorType,storeNames&gt; &amp;model__){ } The particular meaning of the templates etc is not important, but the user should be aware that all parameters, and all quantities depending on parameters should be of type varType1. varTypes could be used more or less as double types in C++. Further, the user should be aware of the amt::amtModel object by default named model__2. The amt::amtModel object keeps track of the names and dimensions of the parameters etc, the value of log-target distribution and so on. operator() typically consist of three parts: specifying the sampled quantities \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) using PARAMETER_* macros. specifying the shape of the target distribution \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). specifying other quantities of interest for which samples are recorded. In what follows, each of these point are discussed in more detail: 4.3.1 The PARAMETER_* macros The sampled quantities (e.g. parameters, latent variables and so on) are specified using the PARAMETER_* macros: PARAMETER_SCALAR(&lt;name&gt;,...); // C++ storage: varType PARAMETER_VECTOR(&lt;name&gt;,dim,...); // C++ storage: Eigen::Matrix&lt;varType,Eigen::Dynamic,1&gt; PARAMETER_MATRIX(name,dim1,dim2,...); // C++ storage: Eigen::Matrix&lt;varType,Eigen::Dynamic,Eigen::Dynamic&gt; PARAMETER_SPD_MATRIX(name,dim,...); // C++ storage: amt::SPDmatrix&lt;varType&gt; All of these macros presume that the argument to the operator()-function is named model__. After a call to e.g. PARAMETER_VECTOR(&lt;name&gt;,dim,...);, a vector of varTypes of dimension dim and with name &lt;name&gt; will be available subsequently. The SPDmatrixclass template is further explained in Chapter 5.1 An optional argument - the default value - may be passed to each of the PARAMETER_* macros. The default value is used when initiating the sampling, and it is important that \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) is defined when \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) corresponds to the default values. If no default values is provided, the default value is implicitly set to \\(0\\). (Non-zero) default values could be either double scalars which are repeated to fill non-scalar variables, e.g. PARAMETER_VECTOR(mu,4,1.0);// mu is intiated at (1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0) Otherwise, the default values may be vectors/matrices of the same dimension(s) as the parameter, e.g. Eigen::Vector muDefault(4); muDefault.setZero(); muDefault(3) = 2.0; PARAMETER_VECTOR(mu,muDefault.size(),muDefault); // mu is intiated at (0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0) One may even pass the dimension and default values of the parameters using the DATA_*: struct model{ DATA_VECTOR(dvec); void preProcess(){} template &lt; class varType, class tensorType, bool storeNames&gt; void operator()(amt::amtModel&lt;varType,tensorType,storeNames&gt; &amp;model__){ PARAMETER_VECTOR(d,dvec.size(),dvec); // d will have the dimension of dvec, and default values=dvec // rest of model spec here } }; Note that there are no facilities for specifying that certain elements \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) to be restricted to a certain range (e.g. positive). Hence the user is responsible for ensuring that suitable transformations are made to avoid numerical problems. See e.g. the log-transformation of the standard deviation in the example in Section 3.1 4.3.2 Specifying the shape of \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Specifying the shape of the target distribution is done using various overloaded += operators applied to the amt::amtModel object. It is assumed that \\(\\log \\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) may be written as the sum of several log-densities. Two sets of such log-densities are available: For fixed metric samplers and Riemannian samplers (see Chapter (ref:the-samplers) for details), a library of log-densities with names ending with _ld or _lm are available under namesspace amt. These are further documented in Chapter 5 For fixed metric samplers only, the complete set of stan::math functions with names ending with _lpdf or _lpmf (see https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html) are available Below are two examples, both specifying a 4-dimensional standard normal target distribution: //... template &lt; class varType, class tensorType, bool storeNames&gt; void operator()(amt::amtModel&lt;varType,tensorType,storeNames&gt; &amp;model__){ PARAMETER_VECTOR(x,4); model__ += normal_ld(x,0.0,1.0); // amt version } //... //... template &lt; class varType, class tensorType, bool storeNames&gt; void operator()(amt::amtModel&lt;varType,tensorType,storeNames&gt; &amp;model__){ PARAMETER_VECTOR(x,4); model__ += stan::math::normal_lpdf(x,0.0,1.0); // stan::math version } //... Further, more elaborate examples of model specifications are provided in Chapter 7. 4.3.3 Generated quantities Generated quantities are used in two ways: It is often the case that one is interested in the posterior distribution of some auxiliary quantities which depend on the parameter \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). The pdmphmc package has the capability to compute “time-integrated” samples (see e.g. Kleppe (2022a), Equation 7 and Figure 3), which in certain cases may be much more efficient for estimating certain moments. Time integrated samples are computed for all generated quantities (and not the parameters, so if you want time-integrated samples of the parameters, pass them as generated quantities). To record such quantities, the generated() function (member of amt::amtModel) is used. There are several overloads of generated() allowing several types (scalars, vectors, matrices etc.) to be passed. The generated() functions have signatures similar to inline void generated(const &lt;SOME TYPE&gt;&amp; value,const std::string&amp; name), where &lt;SOME TYPE&gt; is a C++ type/template, such as e.g. double, Eigen::VectorXd or varType. name is the name used for the generated quantity in the output. Below is a complete example of the usage. First, the content of file generated_model.cpp: using namespace amt; double quadNorm(const Eigen::VectorXd&amp; x){ return(x.dot(x)); } struct model{ void preProcess(){} // not used in this example template &lt; class varType, class tensorType, bool storeNames&gt; void operator()(amt::amtModel&lt;varType,tensorType,storeNames&gt; &amp;model__){ PARAMETER_VECTOR(x,4); // parameter (sampled quantity) model__+=normal_ld(x,0.0,1.0); // add standard normal log-density // make the whole parameter a generated model__.generated(asDouble(x),&quot;x_gen&quot;); // different transformations of x to be recored: model__.generated(std::pow(asDouble(x(0)),3),&quot;x1_cube&quot;); model__.generated(exp(asDouble(x(1))),&quot;x2_exp&quot;); double qn = quadNorm(asDouble(x)); model__.generated(qn,&quot;quadraticNorm&quot;); } }; // end of struct Note that it is good practice to provide double values as the first argument to generated(). The double value of AD types varType obtains using the asDouble() function. Then build and run the model: model &lt;- pdmphmc::build(&quot;generated_model.cpp&quot;) ## model name : model ## process type : HMCProcess ## metric tensor type : metricTensorDummy ## compilation exited successfully fit &lt;- pdmphmc::run(model) fit ## run output for model: model ## # of chains : 4 ## Summary based on discrete samples: ## mean se_mean sd n_eff Rhat ## x[1] -0.017 0.017 0.973 3391 1.003 ## x[2] 0.007 0.017 1.037 3546 1.004 ## x[3] 0.006 0.017 1.024 3736 1.000 ## x[4] 0.006 0.017 0.977 3329 1.002 ## x_gen[1] -0.017 0.017 0.973 3391 1.003 ## x_gen[2] 0.007 0.017 1.037 3546 1.004 ## x_gen[3] 0.006 0.017 1.024 3736 1.000 ## x_gen[4] 0.006 0.017 0.977 3329 1.002 ## x1_cube -0.032 0.058 3.627 3849 1.003 ## x2_exp 1.719 0.039 2.305 3440 1.003 ## quadraticNorm 4.026 0.068 2.846 1720 1.001 ## summary based on integrated samples: ## estimate se_estimate n_eff Rhat ## x_gen[1] 0.005 0.005 5963 1.005 ## x_gen[2] 0.003 0.005 5811 1.002 ## x_gen[3] 0.004 0.005 6267 1.000 ## x_gen[4] -0.003 0.005 5968 0.999 ## x1_cube 0.008 0.018 6574 1.006 ## x2_exp 1.718 0.038 989 1.003 ## quadraticNorm 4.043 0.067 838 1.003 ## NOTE: integrated samples do NOT reflect the complete target distibution, only indicated moments with respect to the target distribution It is seen that discrete time samples (which reflect target distribution) are recorded (by default) for the parameters (in this case x[1],…,x[4]) and the generated quantities (here x_gen[1],…,x_gen[4],x1_cube,x2_exp,quadraticNorm). Integrated samples for calculating moments with respect to the target distribution are recorded for the generated quantities only. Some minor comments related to performance are in order here: As seen in the example above, double values (or vectors or matrices thereof) should ideally be passed to the generated() functions. This is in order of avoiding unnecessary AD computations. In particular, if the generated function is a complicated function of the parameters (for which function quadNorm() may serve as a placeholder), the computations leading up to the generated quantity should be done in double-variables. In models where \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is high-dimensional and parts of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) are of less interest, the default behavior of storing samples of all of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) may be overridden by using the store.pars argument in pdmphmc::run(). Reducing the number of stored quantities leads to both memory savings and savings in terms of computing time.

The library provides an automatic implementation of the methodology of Kleppe (2022b) for automatically computing a “metric tensors” suitable Riemannian sampling algorithms for arbitrary models. The design of the library allows the user to use the same model specification for both Riemannian and regular fixed metric sampling (see Chapter 6). The methodology of Kleppe (2022b) generally requires that all probability densities involved in the model where the argument depends on \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) (generally the conditional densities of priors and latent variables) to have continuous first order derivatives. To achieve such continuity, many of the below distributions are known probability distributions that have been transformed to have support on the whole real line in such a way that the resulting probability distribution is sufficiently smooth. These transformations are also desirable from a numerical point of view. As a basic example of such transformations involves the \\(ExpGamma\\)-distribution (see below for proper definition): // inside operator()() PARAMETER_SCALAR(logSigma,0.0); model__+=expGamma_ld(logSigma,1.0,1.0); varType sigma=exp(logSigma); model__.generated(asDouble(sigma),&quot;sigma&quot;); In the above example, sigma will be exponentially distributed with mean 1 (until further conditioning is done) and will be recorded as a generated quantity. 5.1 Utilities for symmetric positive definite matrices The amt-package provides a set of utilities for representing symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Internally, this class template SPDmatrix represents a \\(d \\times d\\) SPD matrix as an “internal” vector of \\(d(d+1)/2\\) varTypes. SPDmatrix objects may be used as e.g. covariance- or precision matrices in multivariate normal distributions, and it also possible to assign e.g. Wishart distributions on such objects (though in practice, such assignments are really distributions on the internal vector, consistent with the matrix-valued distribution). The easiest way to construct a SPDmatrix is via the PARAMETER_SPD_MATRIX(name,dim,...) macro. Typical usage involves something like: // inside operator()() : PARAMETER_SPD_MATRIX(P,3); // Note: PARAMETER_SPD_MATRIX(P,3) really makes a parameter vector // named P_internal, and subsequently constructs SPDmatrix&lt;varType&gt; P Eigen::VectorXd scaleDiag; scaleDiag.setConstant(3,4.0); model__ += wishartDiagScale_ld(P,scaleDiag,10.0); // P has a Wishart(4*I,10.0) distribution a priori model__.generated(P,&quot;P&quot;); // full matrix stored model__.generated(P.coeff(0,2),&quot;P13&quot;); // single element stored A complete class where the above code block is the body of the operator()()-method is stored in the file wishart_example.cpp, which is built an run via: mdl &lt;- pdmphmc::build(&quot;wishart_example.cpp&quot;) ## model name : model ## process type : HMCProcess ## metric tensor type : metricTensorDummy ## compilation exited successfully fit &lt;- pdmphmc::run(mdl) fit ## run output for model: model ## # of chains : 4 ## Summary based on discrete samples: ## mean se_mean sd n_eff Rhat ## P_internal[1] 3.570 0.010 0.491 2369 1.002 ## P_internal[2] 3.468 0.010 0.492 2455 1.004 ## P_internal[3] 3.330 0.010 0.542 3228 1.001 ## P_internal[4] 0.000 0.007 0.366 3128 1.002 ## P_internal[5] -0.008 0.007 0.362 2862 1.001 ## P_internal[6] 0.008 0.007 0.377 2577 1.002 ## P[1,1] 39.708 0.370 18.407 2467 1.002 ## P[2,1] 0.134 0.229 12.988 3225 1.002 ## P[3,1] -0.025 0.241 12.947 2874 1.000 ## P[2,2] 40.107 0.347 17.647 2581 1.003 ## P[3,2] 0.284 0.248 12.982 2726 1.003 ## P[3,3] 40.197 0.305 18.000 3479 1.002 ## P13 -0.025 0.241 12.947 2874 1.000 ## summary based on integrated samples: ## estimate se_estimate n_eff Rhat ## P[1,1] 39.707 0.184 1838 1.005 ## P[2,1] 0.028 0.056 7138 1.034 ## P[3,1] 0.053 0.053 6941 1.029 ## P[2,2] 40.200 0.182 1768 1.001 ## P[3,2] 0.144 0.101 2184 1.002 ## P[3,3] 40.235 0.163 2335 1.001 ## P13 0.053 0.053 6941 1.029 ## NOTE: integrated samples do NOT reflect the complete target distibution, only indicated moments with respect to the target distribution Notice that by default, the “internal” parameter vector P_internal is stored3 in addition to the generated quantities.

(2018)) with Hamiltonian dynamic between events (see Kleppe (2022a)). Two distinct such samplers are so far implemented: fixed mass (section 6.1) and Riemannian manifold (Section 6.2). The Hamiltonians, which are fully specifies the between event dynamics are provided below. The same set of numerical differential equation solvers (Section 6.3) are used for both solvers. Finally, methods for adapting the scaling of the differential equations (Section 6.4) and the different available event intensities (Section 6.5) are described below. The sampling algorithm to be used are chosen prior to the compilation pdmphmc::build(). By default, a fixed mass sampler is used. Whether to use the RM sampler or fixed metric sampler is inherently problem-specific. As a rule of thumb, if your target distribution involves complicated non-linear dependencies, or the scale of some subset of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) depends strongly on some other subset of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), the RM sampler is often a good choice. However, the differential equations associated with the RM sampler are more expensive to compute than for the fixed metric sampler. Hence, if it is possible to rewrite your model so that the fixed metric sampler gives good results (see e.g. Kleppe (2019) or Osmundsen, Kleppe, and Liesenfeld (2021)), this approach is often a good choice. 6.1 Fixed mass sampler Suppose the target density is given by \\(\\pi (\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) and that the model specification admits the evaluation \\(\\bar \\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\propto \\pi (\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). The Hamiltonian \\(\\mathcal H(\\mathbf q,\\mathbf p)\\) used to define the deterministic dynamics for the fixed mass sampler is \\[ \\mathcal H(\\mathbf q,\\mathbf p) = -\\log \\pi(\\mathbf m + \\mathbf S \\mathbf q) + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf p^T \\mathbf p. \\] Here \\(\\mathbf p\\) is the (fictitious) momentum variable introduced to construct a dynamical system with Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution \\(\\pi(\\mathbf q, \\mathbf p) \\propto \\exp(-\\mathcal H(\\mathbf q,\\mathbf p))\\). Samples are subsequently recorded for \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta=\\mathbf m + \\mathbf S \\mathbf q\\) which will be distributed according to \\(\\pi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Here vector \\(\\mathbf m\\) and diagonal positive definite matrix \\(\\mathbf S\\) are adapted during the warmup process (see Chapter 6.4) The vector \\(\\mathbf m\\) should reflect the mean of the target distribution, and the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf S\\) should reflect the scale properties of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) under the target distribution. The reasoning behind introducing the re-parameterization \\(\\mathbf q \\leftrightarrow \\boldsymbol \\theta\\) (rather than to account for different scales by introducing a non-identity mass matrix in the kinetic energy term of \\(\\mathcal H(\\mathbf q,\\mathbf p)\\)) is based on the desire for obtaining well-scaled Hamilton’s equations \\[ \\dot{ \\mathbf q}(t) = \\mathbf p(t) \\] \\[ \\dot{\\mathbf p}(t) = \\mathbf S \\mathbf g(\\mathbf m+\\mathbf S \\mathbf q(t)), \\; \\mathbf g(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\log \\pi (\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\] suitable for numerical integration. I.e. for suitably chosen \\(\\mathbf S\\) the force term in both equations should have order \\(1\\) (as \\(Var(\\mathbf p)=\\mathbf I\\) under the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution). The sampler is chosen explicitly by selecting process.type = \"HMCProcess\" in the call to pdmphmc::build(), but as mentioned is already the default option. 6.2 Riemann manifold sampler The Riemann manifold (RM) sampler is based on the availability of a “metric tensor” \\(\\mathbf G(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Namely for each \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), then \\(\\mathbf G(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) is a symmetric positive definite matrix that may be interpreted as the “local precision matrix” of the target distribution. The amt-library provides an automatic methodology for computing metric tensors from a given model specification (see Kleppe (2022b) for details), and by default this methodology is used if the RM sampler is selected via process.type = \"RMHMCProcess\" in the call to pdmphmc::build(). The Hamiltonian for the RM sampler is given by \\[ \\mathcal H(\\mathbf q,\\mathbf p) = -\\log \\bar \\pi(\\mathbf m + \\mathbf S \\mathbf q) + \\frac{1}{2}\\log(|\\bar{\\mathbf G}(\\mathbf q)|) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf p^T[\\bar{\\mathbf G}(\\mathbf q)]^{-1}\\mathbf p \\] where \\[ \\bar{\\mathbf G}(\\mathbf q) = \\mathbf S^T \\mathbf G(\\mathbf m + \\mathbf S \\mathbf q) \\mathbf S. \\] It is seen that the interpretation of \\(\\mathbf m\\) and \\(\\mathbf S\\) are the same also for the RM sampler, i.e. \\(\\mathbf m\\) should reflect the center/mean of the distribution, and \\(\\mathbf S\\) should reflect the scale of each element in \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). 6.2.1 Metric tensor storage Two storage schemes for the metric tensor are available sparse storage using on the ldl Cholesky factorization (T. A. Davis (2005)) dense storage using the Cholesky factorization of the Stan math library. One should use the sparse storage scheme if the metric tensor is very sparse, which is often the case for hierarchical models. The metric tensor scheme is chosen during the pdmphmc::build()-process by selecting metric.tensor.type = c(\"Sparse\", \"Dense\"). Note that for the sparse storage scheme, the ordering of the parameters may play a role for the performance of the Cholesky factorization (see Timothy A. Davis (2006)). The ordering of the parameters are determined by the ordering of the PARAMETER_* statements in the model specification. 6.2.2 Advanced It is also possible to specify ones own metric tensor. One turns off the default amt-library metric tensor by choosing the option amt=FALSE in the call to pdmphmc::build(). This process will be documented in more detail soon. 6.3 ODE solvers So far, only the order 5 (4) pair of Dormand and Prince (1980) with dense output is used for integrating the differential equations. A PI controller is used for adaptive time step sizes. 6.4 Scaling adaptation So far, only square-roots of estimates of the diagonal elements of \\(Var(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) are available as the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf S\\). See Kleppe (2022a) for details 6.5 Event intensity So far, only constant event intensities are available. See Kleppe (2022a) for details on on the adaptive choice of this constant event intensity.
